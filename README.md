</p>

A **high-performance, multi-threaded hybrid Key-Value Storage Engine** built from scratch using **C++17** and **Node.js**. The project combines a native concurrent storage engine with an Express API gateway to deliver fast in-memory operations, binary persistence, and cloud deployment.

## 📡 API Endpoints

## 1️⃣ Set a Key-Value Pair

**Endpoint**

```http
POST /set
```

**Headers**

```text
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body**

```json
{
  "key": "username",
  "value": "sampr"
}
```

**cURL**

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://concurrent-kv-store.onrender.com/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"key\":\"username\",\"value\":\"sampr\"}"
```

---

## 2️⃣ Get a Value by Key

**Endpoint**

```http
GET /get/:key
```

**Example**

```http
GET /get/username
```

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": "sampr"
}
```

**cURL**

```bash
curl -i https://concurrent-kv-store.onrender.com/get/username
```

---

## 3️⃣ Delete a Key

**Endpoint**

```http
DELETE /del/:key
```

**Example**

```http
DELETE /del/username
```

**cURL**

```bash
curl -i -X DELETE https://concurrent-kv-store.onrender.com/del/username
```

---

## 4️⃣ Save Snapshot & Cloud Backup

**Endpoint**

```http
POST /save
```

**Description**

Triggers the native C++ storage engine to:

- Create a binary snapshot (`vertex_data.db`)
- Persist all in-memory shards to disk
- Automatically back up the snapshot asynchronously to **Supabase Cloud Storage**

**cURL**

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://concurrent-kv-store.onrender.com/save
```

## 🔄 Request Flow

1. Client sends an HTTP request.
2. Express receives and validates the request.
3. Request is forwarded to the C++ engine through `stdin`.
4. The engine hashes the key into one of **16 shards**.
5. A shard-level `shared_mutex` guarantees thread safety.
6. The response is returned back to Express via `stdout`.
7. Express sends the final JSON response to the client.

# ⚙️ Why Hybrid?

Most Node.js applications execute JavaScript on a single thread.

Vertex delegates storage management to a native **C++ engine**, allowing memory operations to fully utilize multiple CPU cores.

### Benefits

- Faster execution
- True parallelism
- Lower API latency
- Better scalability
- Efficient memory management

---

# 💾 Persistence

Instead of storing data as JSON, Vertex serializes memory into a custom binary database.

### Advantages

- Faster serialization
- Lower disk usage
- No JSON parsing overhead
- Automatic recovery after crashes

Snapshot file:

```text
vertex_data.db
```

# 🐳 Docker Deployment

The project includes a production-ready Dockerfile.

The container automatically:

- Builds a lightweight Linux image
- Installs the C++ toolchain
- Compiles the storage engine
- Starts the Express gateway
- Exposes the public HTTP port

Suitable for platforms like **Render**, **AWS**, and **Google Cloud**.
